# Mac Address Spoofer Tool

## What is a mac address?
A media access control address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller for use as a network address in communications within a network segment. This use is common in most IEEE 802 networking technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.
We would like to change it sometimes due to security reasons.


## The structure of a mac address
Mac Address is a 12-digit hexadecimal number (6-Byte binary number), which is mostly represented by Colon-Hexadecimal notation. First 6-digits (say 00:40:96) of MAC Address identifies the manufacturer, called as OUI (Organizational Unique Identifier).


## Compatibility
The tool is currently compatible with linux distributions only.
Tested on:
- Ubuntu (16.04 - 22.04)

## Usage
